# UFO Finder

## Overview
I created a a webpage and a dynamic table using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ES6+ to organize UFO that is sotred as a JavaScript array/list. 

## Results

Using JavaScript, a filter was created which listens to "inputs" based on the users search. These filters are date, city, state, country, and shape. When a user inputs "el cajon" as the city, all UFO sightings that have occured in Frresno are filterd. Example:

Similarly, when a user inputs "florida" as the state, all UFO sightings in Florida are filted. Example:

## Summary
One drawback of this dynamic table is that the displayed results are limited to the users knowledge of what is in the table. One possible solution to this, for example, might be a drop down menu with different categories per filter. This way, a UFO enthusiast who doesn't know all of the possible options to filter "shape" would make an informed decision.
