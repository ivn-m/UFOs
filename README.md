# UFO Finder

## Overview
I created a a webpage and a dynamic table using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ES6+ to organize UFO that is sotred as a JavaScript array/list. I wrote JavaScript code that listens for date, city, state, country, or shape filters, which then allows the user to sort the data through those filters.
